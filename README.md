# Executive Summary

Objective: To develop a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting an individual's risk of stroke based on various health and demographic factors.

## Methodology:

* Data Acquisition: Utilized a Kaggle dataset containing information on gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence, smoking habits, BMI, and stroke occurrence.
* Data Preprocessing: Conducted data cleaning, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing inconsistencies.
* Model Development: Implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost.
* Feature Selection: Employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most relevant features, including age, heart disease, smoking status, residence, and average blood glucose level.

## Results and Findings:

XGBoost emerged as the most effective model, demonstrating superior performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
Key Performance Metrics:

*Logistic Regression:
Test Accuracy: 0.9029
Test Precision: 0.9861
Test Recall: 0.3902
Test F1-Score: 0.5749
*SVM:
Test Accuracy: 0.4137
Test Precision: 0.5000
Test Recall: 0.3171
Test F1-Score: 0.3951
*XGBoost:
Test Accuracy: 0.9123
Test Precision: 0.9861
Test Recall: 0.8537
Test F1-Score: 0.9151

## Conclusion:

The developed stroke prediction model offers a valuable tool for healthcare providers in identifying individuals at risk of stroke and implementing timely preventive measures. Further research and refinement of the model can contribute to improving stroke prevention efforts and reducing the overall burden of this disease.
